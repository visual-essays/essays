# Getting Started Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating a simple Juncture essay.

## Sign-up for Github account

A Github account is required to use Juncture.  Juncture uses Github for storing and managing content files.  **Github is a free Internet hosting service** commonly used for software development projects.  It provides features for version control and workflow management for distributed teams.

For Juncture we primarly use Github as a file hosting service, similar to how one might use Dropbox or Google Drive. While Juncture is able to use some of the more advanced Github features (like website hosting) the primary use is for storing visual essay text files. Github content is organized into one or more repositories. Users unfamiliar with Github can think of a repository as a workspace, or a collection of folders. 

Juncture users have the option of manually creating and updating essay source files in Github or using the Juncture editor. When using the Juncture editor a user will not need to interact with the Github site directly as the Juncture editor will handle essay file creation and updates.

If you don't already have a Github account one can be created at [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

### Login to Github and authorize Juncture to write Github content {style=clear:unset}

Logging into Github from Juncture authorizes Juncture to interact with your Github repository content from the Juncture Editor tool.
