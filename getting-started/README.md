# Getting Started Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating a simple Juncture essay.

## Sign-up for Github account

A Github account is required to use Juncture.  Juncture uses Github for storing and managing content files.  **Github is a free Internet hosting service** commonly used for software development projects.  It provides features for version control and workflow management for distributed teams.

For Juncture we primarly use Github as a file hosting service, similar to how one might use Dropbox or Google Drive. While Juncture is able to use some of the more advanced Github features (like website hosting) the primary use is for storing visual essay text files. Github content is organized into one or more repositories. Users unfamiliar with Github can think of a repository as a workspace, or a collection of folders. 

Juncture users have the option of manually creating and updating essay source files in Github or using the Juncture editor. When using the Juncture editor a user will not need to interact with the Github site directly as the Juncture editor will handle essay file creation and updates.

If you don't already have a Github account one can be created at [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

### Login to Github {style=clear:unset}

Logging into Github from Juncture authorizes Juncture to interact with your Github repository content from the Juncture Editor tool.  Note that this is an optional step as Github files may be edited directly in the Github web interface or by using any number of client applications running on your local computer. This getting start guide assumes the Juncture Editor is used.

1. ==Select Juncture "Login" from Juncture menu=={0,3}
2. ==Login to Github=={4,7} with your Github username and password.
3. ==Authorize Juncture to write Github content=={9,10}.  This will only be required on an initial login.  (Note that this authorization may be revoked using in [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations))
4. ==Open Juncture editor=={15} after logging in with Github.

### The Juncture Editor

Juncture provides a web-based editor for authoring visual essays.  The editor handles Github content management and includes a convenient preview option for viewing working versions of essays.  The Juncture editor also supports the automatic creation of viewer tags by simply dragging images and other media (including YouTube videos) into the browser window.
