# Getting started with Juncture

## Sign-up for a Github account

In this version of Juncture a Github account must be used for storing and managing user content files.  Users have the option of manually creating and updating essay source files in Github or by using the Juncture Editor.  In either case the Juncture essay rendering engine requires read access to the Github repository storing the content.

## Create a Github repository to store essay source files

After a new Github account has been established, a Github repository must be created to manage the essay text files.  For existing accounts any repository may be used or one may be optionally created for Juncture essay files.  By default Juncture looks for a repository named `essays` when first launching the editor but any repository may be selected.  Juncture essays may also be created in multiple repositories.  For users unfamilir with Github you can think of a repository as a workspace.  Github allows the creation and use of multiple repositories (workspaces).  When using the Juncture editor it will create an `essays` repository if a repository has not yet been created for a new Github account. 

## Log in to Github from Juncture (optional)

Logging into Github from Juncture authorizes Juncture to update your Github repository from the Juncture Editor tool.  Note that this is an optional step as Github files may be edited directly in the Github web interface or by using any number of client applications running on your local computer.  This quick start guide assumes the Juncture Editor is used.
