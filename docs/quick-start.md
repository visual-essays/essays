# Getting started with Juncture

## Sign-up for a Github account

In this version of Juncture a Github account must be used for storing and managing user content files.  Users have the option of manually creating and updating essay source files in Github or by using the Juncture Editor.  In either case the Juncture essay rendering engine requires read access to the Github repository storing the content.

## Create a Github repository to store essay source files

## Log in to Github from Juncture

Logging into Github from Juncture authorizes Juncture to update your Github repository from the Juncture Editor tool.  Note that this is an optional step as Github files may be edited directly in the Github web interface or by using any number of client applications running on your local computer.  This quick start guide assumes the Juncture Editor is used.
